  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    hi, am swathi.
     </p>
  <img src="images/about.jpg" class="col-md  float-end md-3 ms-md-5" alt="..." height="300px" width="300px" >
  <p> attended and graduated from Tel Aviv University with an MBA in business management and psychology. After college, I began my career in Human Resources and Corporate Events for a big Bank. In my work, I gained lots of experience with managing and organizing team events.


After 10 years, I decided to quit my job and pursue my true passion â€” writing and social media management. As you can see the paragraphs gracefully wrap around the floated image. Now imagine how this would look with some actual content in here, rather than just this boring placeholder text that goes on and on, but actually conveys no tangible information at. It simply takes up space and should not really be read.
  </p>

  

  <p>
    My hobbies include reading books, listening to music, watching movies, planning and organizing fun activities for businesses, family, and friends, socializing, and online networking.

My years of experience and love for creating awesome group events for my coworkers, family, and friends have led me to create activitiesforgroups.com.

I know and have seen how bonding, fun, and helpful group events can be and I hope that my site will help you with creating amazing group activities be it with your family, friends, and coworkers.


  <p>
    And yet, here you are, still persevering in reading this placeholder text, hoping for some more insights, or some hidden easter egg of content. A joke, perhaps. Unfortunately, there's none of that here.
